**Séléné** is a lightweight and versatile automation tool, driven by end user customized **Lua scripts** and acting on **MQTT data**.

This branch is under development and incomplete to prepare v4.
Goals are :

- support of Lua 5.3
- ...

** USE ONLY STABLE BRANCH FOR THE MOMENT **

Unfortunately, I don't have times for a decent documentation. But you may find some informations in :

- all comprehensive examples files in *Selenites*
