This file is not a real documentation for Selene (that still has to come) but only a list of think I have to take in account when I'll write this famous documentation.

Compilation options :
=====================

Following directive have to be added to enable some features.

DirectFB :
----------
-DUSE_DIRECTFB
`directfb-config --cflags` `directfb-config --libs`

MQTT (paho)
-----------
-DUSE_MQTT
-lpaho-mqtt3c

(-lpthread not required)

***
SELENE_VERSION - majeur.minorsub (i.e. 0.0112 => major :0, minor : 1, subversion : 12)

createfont( fontname, { size=int } )

font:SetEncoding() can take a string or a id (int) as argument.
In case of string it is converted to id.

createsurface()
	caps : DFBSurfaceCapabilities
	width
	height

SelMQTT.connect()
	keepAliveInterval : int (seconds)
	cleansession : bool
	reliable : bool
	username
	password
	clientID : string 
	persistence : string - if set, indicate the persistence directory
						- if not set, no persistence (data only stored in memory)


MQTT
====

Only textual topic and messages are correctly handled. Result is not defined for non-textual object

func : function called at message arrival. Typically, used to set a SelShared function. Note : callbacks function run on a separate context and, consequently, can't share global variables with the main application or it's loaded libraries.
<- Do we have to launch a tigger function ?

trigger : function running in the main application context mostly used to updated the GUI because the corresponding SelShared has changed.

trigger_once : true if the trigger has to be launched once (default)
			false if the trigger will be launched as many as arrived messages

TODO :
======
MQTT.c : msgarrived - Add wildcard for topic checking
